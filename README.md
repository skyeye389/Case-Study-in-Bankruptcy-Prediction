# Case-Study-in-Bankruptcy-Prediction
This study was part of a project to use Polish manufacturing company data from 2000-2013 to study whether bankruptcy could be predicted from financial ratios using R.
Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data#

Limitations of this study include:**see .pptx for references
1)	the possibility that the financial ratios:
a)	does not capture essential indicators of bankruptcy.
b)	are static representations of the solvency of the firms, overlapping, focus on past performance, may contain errors, inconsistencies and other mistakes which limit the usefulness. 
2)	In addition, this study presumes that the data preparation steps undertaken do not diminish the effectiveness of any emergent models and predictions (Sharma, 2018; Perceptive Analytics (2018)). 
3)	There is no guarantee that the approaches taken, models and predictions developed are the optimum solutions to answering the original hypothesis of bankruptcy predictability(Kovacova et al., 2019).
